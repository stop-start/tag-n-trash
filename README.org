* tag-n-trash: Visually mark and manage code for deletion

`tag-n-trash` is a minor mode for Emacs that lets easily mark for deletion temporary or debug code. It provides visual highlighting of these marked sections and a way to bulk-delete them later.

This is especially useful when debugging or experimenting. It allows to keep track of what code should be removed before a final commit — without cluttering the buffer with comments or TODOs.

---

* Features

- ✅ Mark single lines with a short keyword (e.g. `# TRASH:`)
- ✅ Mark multi-line blocks with `# TRASH-BEGIN` / `# TRASH-END`
- ✅ Highlights "trash" lines in a distinct face
- ✅ Easily delete all tagged code at once with one command
- ✅ Language-agnostic — works in any `prog-mode` buffer

* Installation

**Using Doom Emacs**

1. Add the package in `~/.doom.d/packages.el`:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (package! tag-n-trash
     :recipe (:host github :repo "yourname/tag-n-trash")) ;; Replace with your GitHub username
   #+end_src

2. Run:
   #+begin_src shell
   doom sync
   #+end_src

3. Enable in `~/.doom.d/config.el`:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (use-package! tag-n-trash
     :hook (prog-mode . tag-n-trash-mode))
   #+end_src

**Using straight.el or vanilla Emacs**

Clone the repo somewhere and add to `load-path`:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/tag-n-trash/")
(require 'tag-n-trash)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'tag-n-trash-mode)
#+end_src

---

* Usage

Once `tag-n-trash-mode` is enabled, use the following markers:

- **Single-line tag**:
  #+begin_src python
  print(debug_info)  # TRASH: remove before commit
  #+end_src

- **Multi-line block**:
  #+begin_src python
  # TRASH-BEGIN
  print("Debug 1")
  some_temp_var = compute(x)
  # TRASH-END
  #+end_src

These lines will be highlighted using a special face.

To delete all tagged code at once, run:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x tag-n-trash-delete-all
#+end_src

This command will:
- Remove all single-line `TRASH:` lines
- Remove all blocks between `TRASH-BEGIN` and `TRASH-END`

---

* Customization

You can change the highlight color by customizing the face:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(tag-n-trash-face :background "#330000" :foreground "#ff6666" :weight bold))
#+end_src
